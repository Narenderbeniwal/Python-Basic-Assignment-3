    "Q 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Solution: Use of functions enhances the readability of a program. A big code is always difficult to read. Breaking the code in smaller Functions keeps the program organized, easy to understand and makes it reusable. Also Functions reduce the need for duplicate code. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update. "
